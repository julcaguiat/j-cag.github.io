# **Welcome to my Cyber/Net Hands-On Projects Blog!**<br>
### **About This Blog**
This blog documents my **learning journey in cybersecurity and networking**, combining study, hands-on projects, and practical exercises. I also use platforms like **TryHackMe** to supplement my learning and deepen my understanding of real-world scenarios.<br>
<br>
I’ve built a **virtual lab** that serves as my personal playground for testing, experimentation, and future pentesting practice. For now, my primary focus is **developing strong networking skills** through virtual implementations, but I will eventually build network projects implemented in the **cloud environment and physical devices** as I progress.<br>
<br>
I recently passed the **CompTIA Security+** certification and am currently studying for my **CCNA** certification exam, sharing insights, lab setups, and step-by-step tutorials along the way. This blog is meant to be both a **personal reference** and a **resource for others** following a similar path in cybersecurity and networking.
> 💡 **Tip:** Keep AI assistants like ChatGPT handy — they’re invaluable for troubleshooting, planning labs, and clarifying complex topics as you learn.
