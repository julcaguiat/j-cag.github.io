## 🛡️ Part 4: Windows 10  VM — Adapter Settings & LAN IP Configuration

### 📌 Introduction

    In this part of the lab, we’ll configure the Windows 10 VM with a static IP address for LAN connectivity.<br> This setup ensures that the VM can reliably communicate with the lab network and participate in testing, monitoring, and interactions within the SOC lab environment.

### 💡 Tip: Keep ChatGPT Handy

    If Windows shows “Unidentified Network” or won’t connect, here's a sample promt for ChatGPT:  
      
    “Windows 10 VM on VirtualBox (Internal Network: LabNet) isn’t detecting gateway 192.168.10.1.<br> Here's are my adapter and TCP/IPv4 settings: <provide settings here>. What should I adjust”

### 🔹 Step 1: Windows 10 VM Adapter Configuration

1. **Power off** the Kali-Linux VM.

2. Navigate **Settings** → **Network**.

- **Adapter 1 (LAN):**

  - Check **Enable Network Adapter** [✓]
  - Name: **LabNet** (or any name you want just make sure that all VMs have the same network name)
  - Attached to: **Internal Network**
  - Promiscuous Mode: **Allow All**
  - Click **OK**

### 🔹 Step 2: Configure LAN Static IP Address

1. Boot Windows 10 VM 

2. Configure **Ethernet** (Virtual Adapter) Static IP Addresses:

**Note:** There are different ways of to assign an IP to Windows 10VM. This time we will use Windows graphical interface instead of using CLI(Command-Line Interface).

- Navigate to **Settings** → **Network**

- click **Change adapter options**

3\. Right-click **Ethernet icon**, then click **Properties**

4\. Click **Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)**, then click **Configure**

5\. Set the following:

- Choose **Use the following IP address:**

   	- IP address:            **192.168.10.3**
   	- Subnet Mask: 		     **255.255.255.0**
   	- Default Gateway: 		 **192.168.10.1**
   	
- Choose **Use the following DNS server addresses:**

    - Preferred DNS server:  **192.168.10.1**
    - Alternate DNS server:  **1.1.1.1**

6\. Click **OK**

7\. Open Command Prompt

		Run command:
        
            `ipconfig`

•	The Static IP Address of Windows 10 VM is now set to **192.168.10.3**

8\. Check for connectivity: 

        Run command:
    
            `ping -c 4 192.168.10.1`

            `ping -c 4 google.com`

**Note:** The first ping command is to check connectivity with pfSense VM (internal network). The second ping is to check connectivity to google.com (internet). If the connection ‘timed-out’ – means connection failed. If there are packets transmitted – means success in connection.

9\. Check pfSense Firewall GUI access: 

	- Open browser
	- Access pfSense GUI via: 	 **https://192.168.10.1:8443**

10\. Check Wazuh-Dashboard access: 

	- Open browser
	- Access pfSense GUI via: 	**https://192.168.10.4:443**

🎉 Done! You now have a fully functional **SOC Home Lab** with a **pfSense virtual firewall** for traffic filtering, a **SIEM** for endpoint monitoring, and both an **attack machine** and **target machine** to simulate real-world scenarios. This environment allows you to **practice log analysis**, **test detection rules**, **simulate attacks**, and **strengthen your incident response skills**—all in a **safe and controlled setup**.

👉 Next, we’ll take things a step further by building a **network in a cloud environment**, integrating **Splunk** for advanced log analysis, and exploring **automation**. We’ll also look at ways to **assimilate the cloud lab with our home SOC setup**, creating a more realistic, hybrid environment for testing and learning.
