## 🛡️ Part 1: pfSense VM — Adapter Settings & LAN IP Configuration

### 📌 Introduction

> In this part of the lab, we'll configure pfSense as the firewall and gateway for our 
> home lab SOC setup. We'll attach two adapters (WAN and LAN) and assign a static LAN IP.

### 💡 Tip: Keep ChatGPT Handy

> If pfSense doesn't boot or your LAN IP won't respond, here a sample prompt for ChatGPT:  
> "I'm setting up pfSense in VirtualBox with NAT + Internal adapters. LAN should be 192.168.10.1 
> but it's not reachable. Here's my adapter setup and console output: <_____>. What should I check?"

### 🔹 Step 1: pfSense Adapters (Adapters: 1 [WAN] & 2 [LAN]) Configuration

1. **Power off** the pfSense VM.

2. Open **Settings** → **Network**.

- **Adapter 1 (WAN):** 

> Check **Enable Network Adapter** [✓]
> Attached to: **NAT**
> Promiscuous Mode: **Allow All**
> Click **Port Forwarding**

3\. Click **'+'** (Add button) to add Port Forwarding Rules:

- Enter:

> Name: **pfSense**
> Protocol: **TCP**
> Host IP: **(leave blank)**
> Host Port: **8443**
> Guest IP: **10.0.2.15**
> Guest Port: **8443**

4\. Click **OK**

- **Addapter 2 (LAN):**

> Check **Enable Network Adapter** [✓]
> Attached to: **Internal Network**
> Name: **LabNet** (or any name you want, just make sure all VMs use the same network name).
> Promiscuous Mode: **Allow All**
> Click **OK** to save settings and exit.

### 🔹 Step 2: Configure LAN Static IP Address

1. Boot pfSense and assign interfaces and Static IP Addresses:

	> em0 → **WAN (NAT)** → IP address automatically assigned by VirtualBox
	> em1 → **LAN (Internal Network)** → IP address to be configured manually (Static IP)
       
2. On pfSense Console Menu:

- Enter/Answer as follows:

> Enter an Option: enter  **2**  (Set Interface(s) IP address
> Enter the number of the interface: enter  **2**  (LAN (em1))
> Configure IPv4 address LAN Interface via DHCP: enter  **n**  (we are going to set static IP address)
> Enter the new LAN IPv4 address: enter  **192.168.10.1**  

![](../images/9p1-images/Pf44.png)

- Enter/Answer as follows:

> Enter the new LAN IPv4 subnet mask:  **24**  (w/c is 255.255.255.0 or /24 in CIDR notation)
> For a Wan, enter the new … For a LAN, press <ENTER>…: (leave blank) press    **ENTER**
> Configure IPv6 address LAN interface …: enter  **n**
> Enter the new LAN IPv6 … Press <ENTER> …: (leave blank) press  **ENTER*
> Do you want to enable the DHCP server …: enter  **n**  (we are using static IP for LAN)
> Do you want to revert to HTTPS …: enter  **n**

5\. Press **\<ENTER\>** to continue  → (**you are done!**)

- The Static IP Address of pfSense VM is now set to **192.168.10.1**  
- The pfSense Firewall GUI can be accessed using the URL below from Kali Linux<br> 
or Windows 10 VM browser after their adapter setup:

          `→   https://192.168.10.1:8443`

> 	Default Username: admin  
> 	Default Password: admin

- **Or**, try from your host machine’s browser (thanks to NAT Port Forwarding). 
 
- **If access fails:**  

&nbsp;&nbsp;1. On pfSense VM console, select option **(8) Shell**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Run `pfctl -d` to temporarily disable packet filtering  
&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Then try the URLs below:  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **https://127.0.0.1:8443**
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **https://192.168.10.1:8443**
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **https://localhost:8443**
